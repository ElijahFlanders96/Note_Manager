## Description
This is a program that lets a user write, save, and delete notes using a databse.

## Installation Instructions
This application is live, deployed on heroku. All you need to do to access this app is to follow this link: https://fast-reef-19809.herokuapp.com/notes

## Usage Information
Give your notes a title and then write the text of the note. Once the note is written, you can hit the save button on the top right of the page that looks like a floppy disk, and it will be appended to the left side of the screen as a saved note with a little trashcan icon to its right. If a user wants to delete their note, they can click on the trashcan. Save and delete as many notes as you may need!
